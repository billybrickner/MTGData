    "In that vein, the goal of this notebook is to provide some 'recipes' for analyzing the 17lands data so you can try to whip up some answers of to your own draft related questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook starts out very basic and ramps up to some more complex recipes, but I attempted to select the examples such that they cover a wide variety of types of things you might want to do. Feel free to skip around if you already know what you are doing.\n",

If you have never worked with a coding language before it can be very daunting, but the jist of it is you want to google how to install python for your operating system. Then you want to install `pip`, the python package manager. Once you setup `pip`, install something called `pandas`. \n",
